## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
The **Email Alert Bot** is a Python-based monitoring tool that automatically scans application logs and sends **email notifications** whenever critical failures or errors occur.  
It helps system administrators, developers, and support teams quickly detect issues without manually monitoring log files.  

This project also includes a **Log Writer (fake app)** to simulate real-time log generation for testing purposes.
